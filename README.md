# 3D Kitchen Scene 
This project involved creating a fully realized 3D kitchen scene based on a real-world reference. Key design choices, such as modeling a stove, pot, jars, and bowl, were made to replicate the recognizable layout and feel of the original image. Realistic materials, textures, and dynamic lighting enhanced visual authenticity and clarity. To ensure an immersive experience, I implemented a free-roaming camera system with intuitive keyboard and mouse controls, allowing users to explore the scene from multiple perspectives.
# Design and Development Reflections
When designing software, I start by breaking down the goal into core components and mapping out how each part will interact visually and functionally. In this project, I focused on balancing realism and clarity in the 3D scene while keeping the code modular and maintainable. I followed an iterative design process, starting with the basic layout, refining object positioning, and gradually enhancing visual fidelity. This method allowed me to improve the scene without being overwhelmed by complexity.
Working on this project helped me develop new design skills, such as spatial layout planning, material selection, and interactive camera integration. I also learned how to organize graphics code effectively using modular helper functions, such as those for transformations, texture loading, and shader configuration. These tactics, especially modular coding and iteration, are strategies I'll continue using in future projects to stay organized and efficient.
From a development perspective, I learned to plan each feature before implementation, test incrementally, and refine through feedback. Iteration was key: I often revisited lighting, positioning, and controls to improve usability and realism. As I progressed through milestones, I became more confident using OpenGL techniques and structuring reusable code, making the final scene more polished and manageable.
Computer science helps me reach my goals by providing tools to create interactive and visual experiences. Computational graphics, in particular, has given me a deeper understanding of rendering pipelines, user interaction, and real-time visualization, which are valuable skills in education and professional work. Whether I pursue game development, simulation design, or UI visualization, the knowledge gained from this project gives me a strong foundation on which to build.
